       "<p><strong>TOP 200 DRUGS</strong>: As part of our efforts to educate students about how chemistry positively impacts our lives, my research group has created the pharmaceutical posters shown below, which can be downloaded for free as high resolution PDF files from our website. We envisioned that this attractive graphical information would be a useful tool for teaching both undergraduate and graduate students in addition to serving as a spring board of ideas for researchers interested in the development of new synthetic methods and strategies. I hope everyone enjoys these posters as much as we have and I encourage all visitors to download them and use for teaching, fun chemical browsing, research purposes or even as an attractive and accessible graphical summary to help communicate to the public the critical role organic chemistry plays in the development of new medicines. New posters are completed and posted late in April every year. (Please e-mail us any mistakes you come across and we will make sure to correct them promptly). Part of material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants No. 0848324,1266365 and now 1565500. <em><strong>Please contact us directly if you need higher resolution PDF files than those presented on this website</strong></em></p>\n",
