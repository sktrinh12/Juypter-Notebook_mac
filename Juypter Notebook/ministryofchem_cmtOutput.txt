The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour. Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings.\n\nAtropine occurs naturally in a number of plants of the nightshade family including deadly nightshade, Jimson weed, and mandrake.

 ['#Fluoroantimonic #acid is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2FSbF6 (also written H2F[SbF6], 2HF¬∑SbF5, or simply HF-SbF5). It has a pKa of -31.3. It is an ionic liquid produced by treating hydrogen fluoride (HF) with antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. It is the strongest #superacid. It is particularly #corrosive and #toxic. It has been shown to protonate even hydrocarbons to afford pentacoordinate carbocations. Similar acids can be created by using excess antimony pentafluoride.\n\nThe acid is often said to contain "naked #protons", but the "free" protons are, in fact, always bonded to hydrogen #fluoride molecules to make the fluoronium cations (similar to the hydronium cation in aqueous solution). It is the fluoronium ion that accounts for fluoroantimonic acid\'s extreme #acidity. Fluoroantimonic acid is 1016 (10 quadrillion) times stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. The protons easily migrate through the solution, moving from H2F+ to HF, when present, by the Grotthuss mechanism:\n\nH2F+ + HF ‚áå HF + H2F+\n\n#Fluoroantimonicacid thermally decomposes at higher temperatures, generating hydrogen fluoride gas.

Yoshito Kishi's group at Harvard University first synthesized palytoxin in 1994. Palytoxin targets the sodium-potassium pump protein by locking it into a position where it allows passive transport of both sodium and potassium ions, thereby destroying the ion gradient that is essential for life. Because palytoxin can affect every type of cell in the body, the symptoms can be very different for the various routes of exposure. The most common exposure in humans is by ingestion or inhalation. The onset of symptoms is rapid, and death usually follows quickly. (Wikipedia)\n\nFurther reading: Budavari, Susan, ed.

  'Synthesis of cubane.\nThe classic 1964 #synthesis starts with the conversion of 2-cyclopentenone to 2-bromocyclopentadienone.\n\n#Allylic #bromination with N-bromosuccinimide in #carbon #tetrachloride followed by addition of #molecular #bromine to the #alkene gives a 2,3,4-tribromocyclopentanone. Treating this #compound with #diethylamine in diethyl #ether causes #elimination of two equivalents of hydrogen bromide to give the #diene #product. (Image 1)\n\nThe construction of the eight-carbon cubane framework begins when 2-bromocyclopentadienone undergoes a spontaneous Diels-Alder dimerization, analogous to the dimerization of cyclopentadiene to dicyclopentadiene‚Äîtwo molecules of 1 react to form 2. For the subsequent steps to succeed, only the endo isomer is useful, and this is the predominant isomer formed in this reaction. This is the most likely product as a result of minimized steric interactions between the bromine of each molecule with the bromine and carbonyl of the other when the reactants approach each other and minimized like-dipole interactions in the transition state of the reaction itself. Both carbonyl groups are protected as acetals with ethylene glycol and p-toluenesulfonic acid in benzene; one acetal is then selectively deprotected with aqueous hydrochloric acid to 3.\nIn the next step, the endo isomer 3 (with both alkene groups in close proximity) forms the cage-like isomer 4 in a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The bromoketone group is converted to ring-contracted carboxylic acid 5 in a Favorskii rearrangement with potassium hydroxide. Next, the thermal decarboxylation takes place through the acid chloride (with thionyl chloride) and the tert-butyl perester 6 (with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and pyridine) to 7; afterward, the acetal is once more removed in 8. A second #Favorskii #rearrangement gives 9, and finally another #decarboxylation gives, via 10, cubane (11). (Image 2)\n\nReferences:\nEaton, Philip E.; Cole, Thomas W. (1964). "Cubane". J. Am. Chem.

  'Synthesis of cubane.\nThe classic 1964 #synthesis starts with the conversion of 2-cyclopentenone to 2-bromocyclopentadienone.\n\n#Allylic #bromination with N-bromosuccinimide in #carbon #tetrachloride followed by addition of #molecular #bromine to the #alkene gives a 2,3,4-tribromocyclopentanone. Treating this #compound with #diethylamine in diethyl #ether causes #elimination of two equivalents of hydrogen bromide to give the #diene #product. (Image 1)\n\nThe construction of the eight-carbon cubane framework begins when 2-bromocyclopentadienone undergoes a spontaneous Diels-Alder dimerization, analogous to the dimerization of cyclopentadiene to dicyclopentadiene‚Äîtwo molecules of 1 react to form 2. For the subsequent steps to succeed, only the endo isomer is useful, and this is the predominant isomer formed in this reaction. This is the most likely product as a result of minimized steric interactions between the bromine of each molecule with the bromine and carbonyl of the other when the reactants approach each other and minimized like-dipole interactions in the transition state of the reaction itself. Both carbonyl groups are protected as acetals with ethylene glycol and p-toluenesulfonic acid in benzene; one acetal is then selectively deprotected with aqueous hydrochloric acid to 3.\nIn the next step, the endo isomer 3 (with both alkene groups in close proximity) forms the cage-like isomer 4 in a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The bromoketone group is converted to ring-contracted carboxylic acid 5 in a Favorskii rearrangement with potassium hydroxide. Next, the thermal decarboxylation takes place through the acid chloride (with thionyl chloride) and the tert-butyl perester 6 (with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and pyridine) to 7; afterward, the acetal is once more removed in 8.

  'Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula C6H5OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile. The molecule consists of a phenyl group (‚àíC6H5) bonded to a hydroxyl group (‚àíOH). It is mildly acidic and requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause chemical burns.\n\nPhenol was first extracted from coal tar, but today is produced on a large scale (about 7 billion kg/year) from petroleum. It is an important industrial commodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds. It is primarily used to synthesize plastics and related materials. Phenol and its chemical derivatives are essential for production of polycarbonates, epoxies, Bakelite, nylon, detergents, herbicides such as phenoxy herbicides, and numerous pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nThe worldwide phenol market is estimated to be valued at USD 31.73 billion by 2025. Asia Pacific holds the highest market share. Asia Pacific market is anticipated to project a CAGR of 4.9% from 2014 to 2025.\n\n#beautifulchemistry #chemistryisbeautiful #chemistry #biology #science #staynerdy #moleculeoftheday #molecule #phenol #yesthisisstill #phenolweek \n#phenol #theoneandonly #petroleum #nylon #drugs #everything',

  'N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT or N,N-DMT) is a psychedelic compound of the tryptamine family. When ingested, DMT is able to cross the human blood-brain-barrier, allowing it to act as a powerful hallucinogenic drug that dramatically affects human consciousness.\nIt is a structural analog of serotonin and melatonin and a functional analog of other psychedelic tryptamines such as 4-AcO-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 5-HO-DMT, psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), and psilocin (4-HO-DMT).\nHistorically, it has been consumed by indigenous Amazonian cultures in the form of ayahuasca for divinatory and healing purposes. It was first synthesised in 1931, and in 1946, microbiologist Oswaldo Gon√ßalves de Lima discovered its natural presence in plants.\n\n#dmt #ayahuasca #drug #hallucinogen #drugs #serotonin #psilocybin #chemistry #molecule #moleculeoftheday #science #biology #chemistryisbeautiful #chemistrylove',

It is used mainly as an entheogen, recreational drug, and as an agent in psychedelic therapy.
