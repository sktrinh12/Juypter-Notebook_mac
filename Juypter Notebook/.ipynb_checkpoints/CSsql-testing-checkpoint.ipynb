It was first isolated in 1934 as the hydrolysis product of croton oil, which is derived from the seeds of the purging croton, Croton tiglium. The seeds and oil of this special plant have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine, generally as a laxative (purgative). In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response. Phorbol esters are also used to stimulate the immune response in test subjects, and measure their response to pain. On the flip side, some phorbol derivatives have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria.

In its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive, with physical shock causing it to explode. Furthermore, it degrades over time to even more unstable forms, making pure nitroglycerin highly dangerous to transport or use. In fact, is one of the world's most powerful explosives, comparable to the more recently developed RDX and PETN. Invented in 1847, this substance was the first practical explosive produced that was stronger than black powder. Later it was adopted as a commercially useful explosive by Alfred Nobel, who experimented with safer ways to handle the dangerous compound. Nobel mixed nitroglycerin with inert absorbents, particularly diatomaceous earth, and he named this explosive dynamite, patenting it in 1867. Now, nitroglycerin is still used in the form of dynamite, for drilling highway and railroad tunnels, for mining, for clearing farmland of stumps, in quarrying, and in demolition work. Nitroglycerin has also been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. Unlike many other high explosives, nitroglycerin produces practically no visible smoke on detonation. Therefore, it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of smokeless powder for military use. Interestingly, nitroglycerin has been used for over 100 years as a medicine for heart diseases, especially heart attacks, angina and cardiac failure. It works by correcting the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart.

The octanitrocubane molecule has the same chemical structure as cubane (C8H8), where 8 carbon atoms are arranged at each corner of a cube, except that each of the eight hydrogen atoms in cubane is replaced by a nitro group (NO2). The cubic shape of octanitrocubane requires the carbon atoms to adopt an unusually sharp 90° bonding angle, which is highly strained. Hence, octanitrocubane has very high chemical potential energy. In fact, this substance has a detonation velocity of 10,100 m/s, making it the fastest known explosive. However, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths, octanitrocubane is fairly stable at room temperature and pressure, making it a very useful explosive that will not detonate until triggered. Unfortunately, although octanitrocubane is predicted to be one of the most effective explosives, the difficulty of its synthesis inhibits practical use. Octanitrocubane is currently more valuable, gram for gram, than gold. We probably won't see octanitrocubane being used anytime soon!

This medicine belongs to the family of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and it works by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates such as starch and table sugar in the body. Naturally, it can be most commonly found in mulberry leaves, and it can be obtained in small quantities by brewing an herbal tea from mulberry leaves. Recent interest in the commercial production of this substance has led to research on developing mulberry tea higher in DNJ, and on alternate routes of production, such as via bacteria.

It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odour. This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. At least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. Now, its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention.

When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

Side effects include headaches, nausea and memory loss, and these effects can last for several days. However, the concentration of myristicin in nutmeg oil is far too low to experience such effects. Many folk remedies recommend taking nutmeg oil for nausea, stomach upsets, indigestion, or even toothache. Although none of these remedies are medically proven, nutmeg oil is used in some cough syrups and as a natural food flavouring in baked goods, beverages like Coke (Coca Cola), and sweets. Myristicin is also the traditional precursor for the synthesis of the psychedelic drug MMDA (3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine).

It has powerful, fast-acting sedative and analgesic (painkiller) effects. First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks. These side effects has earned krokodil its other nickname: the zombie drug. The typical life span of an addict is just two or three years.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure. This makes abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and acetaminophen potentially fatal.

       "  'Febuxostat, sold under the brand names Uloric among others, is a medication used in the treatment of chronic gout caused by excessive levels of uric acid in the blood, also known as hyperuricemia. Uric acid is formed from the breakdown of certain chemicals called purines in the body, and hyperuricemia occurs when the body produces more uric acid than it can eliminate. Gout occurs when the uric acid forms crystals in joints and tissues, causing swelling, inflammation and pain. This disease is a form of arthritis and most classically affects the joint in the base of the big toe. Febuxostat prevents the production of uric acid by blocking the activity of the enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that converts purines to uric acid. Febuxostat is typically only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol, which is the standard medicine used by patients to lower uric acid levels and treat gout. This is due to an increased risk of heart-related deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol.

The seeds and oil of this special plant have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine, generally as a laxative (purgative). In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response. Phorbol esters are also used to stimulate the immune response in test subjects, and measure their response to pain. On the flip side, some phorbol derivatives have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria.

       "  \"Tabun, also known as GA, is an extremely toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odour. This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. At least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. Now, its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention.

       "  'Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks. These side effects has earned krokodil its other nickname: the zombie drug. The typical life span of an addict is just two or three years.

       "  \"Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines, including Benylin DM, Mucinex DM and Vicks Nyquil. It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure. This makes abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and acetaminophen potentially fatal.

       "  'Febuxostat, sold under the brand names Uloric among others, is a medication used in the treatment of chronic gout caused by excessive levels of uric acid in the blood, also known as hyperuricemia. Uric acid is formed from the breakdown of certain chemicals called purines in the body, and hyperuricemia occurs when the body produces more uric acid than it can eliminate. Gout occurs when the uric acid forms crystals in joints and tissues, causing swelling, inflammation and pain. This disease is a form of arthritis and most classically affects the joint in the base of the big toe. Febuxostat prevents the production of uric acid by blocking the activity of the enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that converts purines to uric acid. Febuxostat is typically only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol, which is the standard medicine used by patients to lower uric acid levels and treat gout. This is due to an increased risk of heart-related deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol.

The seeds and oil of this special plant have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine, generally as a laxative (purgative). In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response. Phorbol esters are also used to stimulate the immune response in test subjects, and measure their response to pain.

This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader.

When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world.

First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks. These side effects has earned krokodil its other nickname: the zombie drug. The typical life span of an addict is just two or three years.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure.

It can also be used to decrease pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) and prevent potential vision loss. During severe head injuries, mannitol is used to reduce intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull) until more definitive treatment can be applied. Other than for medicinal purposes, mannitol is often used as a sugar substitute, as it is poorly absorbed from the intestines. It is used as an artificial sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Mannitol is classified a sugar alcohol, that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by chemical reduction. Industrially, it is chemically synthesised by reacting fructose with hydrogen. Interestingly, mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses.

This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader.

When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world.

First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure.

It can also be used to decrease pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) and prevent potential vision loss. During severe head injuries, mannitol is used to reduce intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull) until more definitive treatment can be applied. Other than for medicinal purposes, mannitol is often used as a sugar substitute, as it is poorly absorbed from the intestines. It is used as an artificial sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Mannitol is classified a sugar alcohol, that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by chemical reduction. Industrially, it is chemically synthesised by reacting fructose with hydrogen. Interestingly, mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants.

       "  \"Sildenafil, sold as the brand name Viagra among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction in men. Also known as impotence, this is a type of sexual dysfunction characterised by the inability to develop or maintain an erection during sexual activity, which can lead to psychological consequences. It works by relaxing muscles found in the walls of blood vessels and increasing blood flow to particular areas of the body. Viagra is widely recognised in popular culture and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases size. Studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction. Interestingly, viagra is also used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and improve exercise capacity in men and women.

       "  'Glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxidant in the human body, as well as most other organisms like plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria. It is capable of preventing damage to cells, caused by reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, peroxides, and heavy metals. Glutathione plays a crucial role in many chemical reactions in the body. It also helps detoxify chemicals, including some that the body creates naturally, as well as pollutants and drugs. A deficiency  in glutathione could lead to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, the resulting damage of which is thought to be involved in a plethora of diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. Hence, glutathione is sold as an oral health supplement, since many people believe that glutathione can treat weakened immune systems, infertility, and many other conditions. Some use glutathione to protect themselves from the harmful effects of radiation and chemotherapy for cancer. However, there is little scientific evidence supporting the these health benefits.

This medicine has been used since the 1950s, and it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. DMSA works by acting as a chelating agent. This means it binds with heavy metal ions in the body and allows them to safely leave the body via urine. With sufficiently aggressive treatment, DMSA can also reduce lead content in the brain. Interestingly, radioactive technetium-99m can be combined with DMSA to be used in a DMSA scan.

       "  'Efavirenz, sold under the brand names Sustiva among others, is an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Typically, it is taken with other HIV/AIDS drugs, most commonly with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Efavirenz belongs to a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by preventing the HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase from working, which stops the proliferation of HIV in the body. Although efavirenz does not cure HIV, it significantly decreases the chance of developing AIDS and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. By reducing the levels of HIV in the body, this drug may even decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.

Acrylamide is also used in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate charged molecules. This technique is widely accepted today, and remains a common protocol in molecular biology labs. Acrylamide has been the subject of controversy in recent years as high levels of this poisonous and mutagenic substance has been found in starchy food that has been baked or fried. While some research has shown that the amount of acrylamide is sufficient in some food products to increase the chance of cancer in humans, other studies show otherwise.

The other three bases are adenine, cytosine and guanine, and uracil binds to adenine in RNA via hydrogen bonds. Uracil's use in the body is to help carry out the synthesis of many proteins and enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates. It serves as a regulator and coenzyme for reactions in the human body and in plants. Uracil is important for the detoxification of many carcinogens (cancer-causing substances), for instance those found in tobacco smoke. Interestingly, when uracil is reacted with fluorine, 5-fluorouracil is formed, which is a potent anti-cancer drug as it prevents RNA synthesis in cells.

When uric acid levels in the blood get too high, uric acid starts forming hard crystals in joints, causing pain. Colchicine works by reducing swelling and lessening the buildup of uric acid in joints. Interestingly, colchicine is also a toxin at high doses due to its ability to prevent cells from dividing. Hence, side effects from high doses of colchicine may lead to bone marrow damage and hair loss.

Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader.

Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous.

In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe.

This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure. This makes abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and acetaminophen potentially fatal.

The seeds and oil of this special plant have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine, generally as a laxative (purgative). In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response.

This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader.

When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world.

First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks.

While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure.

It can also be used to decrease pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) and prevent potential vision loss. During severe head injuries, mannitol is used to reduce intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull) until more definitive treatment can be applied. Other than for medicinal purposes, mannitol is often used as a sugar substitute, as it is poorly absorbed from the intestines. It is used as an artificial sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Mannitol is classified a sugar alcohol, that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by chemical reduction. Industrially, it is chemically synthesised by reacting fructose with hydrogen. Interestingly, mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses.

This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader.

When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world.

First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure.

It can also be used to decrease pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) and prevent potential vision loss. During severe head injuries, mannitol is used to reduce intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull) until more definitive treatment can be applied. Other than for medicinal purposes, mannitol is often used as a sugar substitute, as it is poorly absorbed from the intestines. It is used as an artificial sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Mannitol is classified a sugar alcohol, that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by chemical reduction. Industrially, it is chemically synthesised by reacting fructose with hydrogen. Interestingly, mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants.

       "  'Glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxidant in the human body, as well as most other organisms like plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria. It is capable of preventing damage to cells, caused by reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, peroxides, and heavy metals. Glutathione plays a crucial role in many chemical reactions in the body. It also helps detoxify chemicals, including some that the body creates naturally, as well as pollutants and drugs. A deficiency  in glutathione could lead to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, the resulting damage of which is thought to be involved in a plethora of diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. Hence, glutathione is sold as an oral health supplement, since many people believe that glutathione can treat weakened immune systems, infertility, and many other conditions. Some use glutathione to protect themselves from the harmful effects of radiation and chemotherapy for cancer. However, there is little scientific evidence supporting the these health benefits.

This medicine has been used since the 1950s, and it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. DMSA works by acting as a chelating agent. This means it binds with heavy metal ions in the body and allows them to safely leave the body via urine. With sufficiently aggressive treatment, DMSA can also reduce lead content in the brain. Interestingly, radioactive technetium-99m can be combined with DMSA to be used in a DMSA scan. When imaged with a gamma camera, this scan can be used to assess renal morphology, structure and function.

Physostigmine easily crosses the blood–brain barrier and works by enhancing the transmission of acetylcholine in the brain. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter released by nerve cells to send brain signals.

It was previously used for malaria but is no longer recommended due to resistance. In 2015, with Turing Pharmaceuticals' acquisition of the US marketing rights for pyrimethamine, the cost of a monthly course for a person on 75 mg dose shot to about $75,000/month, or $750 per tablet. This was an outrageous 5000% price hike. Despite fierce worldwide criticism, the CEO of Turing, Martin Shrekli, defended the price hike and refused to lower the current price to maintain the high revenue.

Thiamine-rich food include whole grains, yeast, beans, nuts, and some meats and fish. The body needs thiamine to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is a molecule that transports energy within cells. Thiamine deficiency is seen mainly in chronic alcoholism, people suffering from HIV/AIDS, and diabetics. Severe deficiency can lead to disorders like beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and optic neuropathy. Hence, thiamine can be taken as a supplement to treat these disorders. Research shows that high thiamine intake as part of the diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts and kidney disease.

The other three bases are adenine, cytosine and guanine, and uracil binds to adenine in RNA via hydrogen bonds. Uracil's use in the body is to help carry out the synthesis of many proteins and enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates. It serves as a regulator and coenzyme for reactions in the human body and in plants. Uracil is important for the detoxification of many carcinogens (cancer-causing substances), for instance those found in tobacco smoke. Interestingly, when uracil is reacted with fluorine, 5-fluorouracil is formed, which is a potent anti-cancer drug as it prevents RNA synthesis in cells.

It works by slowing the heart rate so the heart can pump more blood through the body each time it beats. Ivabradine can also be used to treat chronic heart pain, especially when the patient is unable to consume the typical heart pain medications. An interesting side effect is luminous phenonena, which patients describe as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field.

When uric acid levels in the blood get too high, uric acid starts forming hard crystals in joints, causing pain. Colchicine works by reducing swelling and lessening the buildup of uric acid in joints. Interestingly, colchicine is also a toxin at high doses due to its ability to prevent cells from dividing. Hence, side effects from high doses of colchicine may lead to bone marrow damage and hair loss.

According to the Global Drug Survey 2014, 2C-B ranks among the top 20 drugs for past-year prevalence in nine different countries, with the highest prevalence in the United Kingdom. Relatively little is known about the effects this drug has on the human body.

       " 'Happy moleculemonday !\\n\\nAtropine is a medication to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate and to decrease saliva production during surgery. It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Eye drops are also available which are used to treat uveitis and early amblyopia. The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour. Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings.\\n\\nAtropine occurs naturally in a number of plants of the nightshade family including deadly nightshade, Jimson weed, and mandrake. It was first isolated in 1833.

It is a colorless solid.\\n\\nBenzimidazoles are often bioactive. Many anthelmintic drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, triclabendazole etc.) belong to the benzimidazole class of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides are commercialized. They act by binding to the fungal microtubules and stopping hyphal growth. It also binds to the spindle microtubules and blocks nuclear division.

It is an ionic liquid produced by treating hydrogen fluoride (HF) with antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. It is the strongest #superacid. It is particularly #corrosive and #toxic. It has been shown to protonate even hydrocarbons to afford pentacoordinate carbocations.

It is the fluoronium ion that accounts for fluoroantimonic acid\\'s extreme #acidity. Fluoroantimonic acid is 1016 (10 quadrillion) times stronger than 100% sulfuric acid.

Palytoxin is a #natural #compound, #chemically a fatty alcohol, that is produced by several #anthozoans but can be found in many more species, especially #fish, due to the process of #biomagnification. Palytoxin was originally isolated in 1971 in Hawaii from the seaweed-like #coral limu-make-o-Hana ('seaweed of death from Hana').[4] In 1982, its full chemical structure was published by Prof. Daisuke Uemura and co-workers at Nagoya University. Yoshito Kishi's group at Harvard University first synthesized palytoxin in 1994. Palytoxin targets the sodium-potassium pump protein by locking it into a position where it allows passive transport of both sodium and potassium ions, thereby destroying the ion gradient that is essential for life. Because palytoxin can affect every type of cell in the body, the symptoms can be very different for the various routes of exposure. The most common exposure in humans is by ingestion or inhalation. The onset of symptoms is rapid, and death usually follows quickly. (Wikipedia)\\n\\nFurther reading: Budavari, Susan, ed.

Estradiol is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics such as the breasts, widening of the hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution in women and is important in the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues such as the mammary glands, uterus, and vagina during puberty, adulthood, and pregnancy.[1] It also has important effects in many other tissues including bone, fat, skin, liver, and the brain. While estradiol levels in men are much lower compared to those in women, estradiol has important roles in men as well. Aside from humans and other mammals, estradiol is also found in most vertebrates and crustaceans, insects, fish, and other animal species.[2][3] [1] Ryan KJ (August 1982). \"Biochemistry of aromatase: significance to female reproductive physiology\".

Caffeine is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive substance, but, unlike many other psychoactive substances, is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity; in North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.\\n#drugs #caffeine #coffee #tea #psychoactive #drug #chemistry #molecule #moleculeoftheday #science #chemistryisbeautiful #chemistrylove',\n",

       "  'Lysergic acid diethylamide, abbreviated LSD or LSD-25, also known as lysergide and colloquially as acid, is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug of the ergoline family, well known for its psychological effects which can include altered thinking processes, closed and open eye visuals, synaesthesia, an altered sense of time and spiritual experiences, as well as for its key role in 1960s counterculture. It is used mainly as an entheogen, recreational drug, and as an agent in psychedelic therapy. LSD is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose, although adverse psychiatric reactions such as anxiety or delusions are possible even at low doses.\\nLSD was first made by Albert Hofmann in Switzerland in 1938 from ergotamine, a chemical from the fungus ergot.\\n\\n#lsd #drug #psychedelic #drugs #visuals #chemistry #hofmann #bicycle #1960s #spiritual #science #molecule #moleculeoftheday #youarehigh #highlikeakite #itsscience #chemistryisbeautiful',\n",
       "  'Ethanol, also commonly called ethyl alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts. It is a neurotoxic psychoactive drug and one of the oldest recreational drugs used by humans. It can cause alcohol intoxication when consumed in sufficient quantity. Ethanol is used as a solvent, an antiseptic, a fuel and the active fluid in modern thermometers. It is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a strong chemical odor. Its structural formula CH3CH2OH, is often abbreviated as C2H5OH, C2H6O or EtOH.\\n\\n#ethanol #alcohol #booze #drinks #party #drug #drugs #etoh #molecule #moleculeoftheday #chemistry #psychoactive #recreational #intoxication #science #chemistryisbeautiful #chemistrylove #thisiswhatmakesyoudrunk',\n",
       "  'N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT or N,N-DMT) is a psychedelic compound of the tryptamine family. When ingested, DMT is able to cross the human blood-brain-barrier, allowing it to act as a powerful hallucinogenic drug that dramatically affects human consciousness.\\nIt is a structural analog of serotonin and melatonin and a functional analog of other psychedelic tryptamines such as 4-AcO-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 5-HO-DMT, psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), and psilocin (4-HO-DMT).\\nHistorically, it has been consumed by indigenous Amazonian cultures in the form of ayahuasca for divinatory and healing purposes. It was first synthesised in 1931, and in 1946, microbiologist Oswaldo Gonçalves de Lima discovered its natural presence in plants.\\n\\n#dmt #ayahuasca #drug #hallucinogen #drugs #serotonin #psilocybin #chemistry #molecule #moleculeoftheday #science #biology #chemistryisbeautiful #chemistrylove',\n",
