It was first isolated in 1934 as the hydrolysis product of croton oil, which is derived from the seeds of the purging croton, Croton tiglium. The seeds and oil of this special plant have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine, generally as a laxative (purgative). In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response. Phorbol esters are also used to stimulate the immune response in test subjects, and measure their response to pain. On the flip side, some phorbol derivatives have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria.

In its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive, with physical shock causing it to explode. Furthermore, it degrades over time to even more unstable forms, making pure nitroglycerin highly dangerous to transport or use. In fact, is one of the world's most powerful explosives, comparable to the more recently developed RDX and PETN. Invented in 1847, this substance was the first practical explosive produced that was stronger than black powder. Later it was adopted as a commercially useful explosive by Alfred Nobel, who experimented with safer ways to handle the dangerous compound. Nobel mixed nitroglycerin with inert absorbents, particularly diatomaceous earth, and he named this explosive dynamite, patenting it in 1867. Now, nitroglycerin is still used in the form of dynamite, for drilling highway and railroad tunnels, for mining, for clearing farmland of stumps, in quarrying, and in demolition work. Nitroglycerin has also been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. Unlike many other high explosives, nitroglycerin produces practically no visible smoke on detonation. Therefore, it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of smokeless powder for military use. Interestingly, nitroglycerin has been used for over 100 years as a medicine for heart diseases, especially heart attacks, angina and cardiac failure. It works by correcting the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart.

The octanitrocubane molecule has the same chemical structure as cubane (C8H8), where 8 carbon atoms are arranged at each corner of a cube, except that each of the eight hydrogen atoms in cubane is replaced by a nitro group (NO2). The cubic shape of octanitrocubane requires the carbon atoms to adopt an unusually sharp 90° bonding angle, which is highly strained. Hence, octanitrocubane has very high chemical potential energy. In fact, this substance has a detonation velocity of 10,100 m/s, making it the fastest known explosive. However, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths, octanitrocubane is fairly stable at room temperature and pressure, making it a very useful explosive that will not detonate until triggered. Unfortunately, although octanitrocubane is predicted to be one of the most effective explosives, the difficulty of its synthesis inhibits practical use. Octanitrocubane is currently more valuable, gram for gram, than gold. We probably won't see octanitrocubane being used anytime soon!

Plastic bottles made from PET are widely used for soft drinks due to its ability to prevent carbon dioxide from escaping. PET film is also often used in tape applications, such as the carrier for magnetic tape or backing for adhesive tapes. PET can even be used as a 3D printing filament. Several million tonnes of PET is produced annually by reacting terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol at moderate pressure and high temperature. Interestingly, the name \"terephthalic acid\" is derived from the turpentine-producing tree Pistacia terebinthus and phthalic acid.

It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odour. This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. At least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. Now, its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention.

When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

If consumed in high quantities, this substance itself is a psychoactive drug, and can produce hallucinations, visual distortions and paranoia, with the person exhibiting a confused, excited state. Side effects include headaches, nausea and memory loss, and these effects can last for several days. However, the concentration of myristicin in nutmeg oil is far too low to experience such effects. Many folk remedies recommend taking nutmeg oil for nausea, stomach upsets, indigestion, or even toothache. Although none of these remedies are medically proven, nutmeg oil is used in some cough syrups and as a natural food flavouring in baked goods, beverages like Coke (Coca Cola), and sweets. Myristicin is also the traditional precursor for the synthesis of the psychedelic drug MMDA (3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine). Interestingly, in the Elizabethan days, nutmeg, along with mace, were more valuable than gold by weight, as they were believed (incorrectly) to be a cure for the bubonic plague that was devastating populations across Europe at that time.

It has powerful, fast-acting sedative and analgesic (painkiller) effects. First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks. These side effects has earned krokodil its other nickname: the zombie drug. The typical life span of an addict is just two or three years.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure. This makes abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and acetaminophen potentially fatal.

Unfortunately, TB is the number 1️⃣ cause of death 💀 from an infectious disease. Each year, there are more than 10 million cases of active TB worldwide, which result in 1.3 million deaths. Pyrazinamide, sold under brand names like Rifater or Tebrazid, is a medication 💊💉 used to treat this deadly disease. It is only used in combination with other drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin, and it is never used on its own. Pyrazinamide is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system 👨\\u200d⚕️👩\\u200d⚕️ Interestingly, one in four people are actually infected with TB!

       "  \"Retinol, also known as Vitamin A1, is a vitamin found naturally in high quantities in food like cod liver oil, butter, liver, eggs, cheese and milk. In the body, this vitamin plays an essential role in vision, particularly night vision, normal bone and tooth development, reproduction, and the health of skin and mucous membranes. Retinol is often used as a dietary supplement for the treatment of vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to night blindness, xerophthalmia (where the eyes fail to produce tears), and complete blindness. Because of retinol's importance in maintaining skin health, retinol is perhaps the gold standard ingredient in the cosmetics industry for reversing skin ageing. Many skincare products ranging from creams to moisturisers contain retinol, and companies often advertise that this substance has the power to help accelerate skin renewal and reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines and age spots for an overall firmer, smoother and more evenly-toned skin.

       "  'Febuxostat, sold under the brand names Uloric among others, is a medication used in the treatment of chronic gout caused by excessive levels of uric acid in the blood, also known as hyperuricemia. Uric acid is formed from the breakdown of certain chemicals called purines in the body, and hyperuricemia occurs when the body produces more uric acid than it can eliminate. Gout occurs when the uric acid forms crystals in joints and tissues, causing swelling, inflammation and pain. This disease is a form of arthritis and most classically affects the joint in the base of the big toe. Febuxostat prevents the production of uric acid by blocking the activity of the enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that converts purines to uric acid. Febuxostat is typically only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol, which is the standard medicine used by patients to lower uric acid levels and treat gout. This is due to an increased risk of heart-related deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol.

It belongs to the family of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which work by blocking the body's production of certain natural substances called prostaglandins that cause inflammation. Naproxen is often used to treat diseases of joints, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and gout. It is also used for menstrual cramps, muscle and bone disorders, including back pain, sprains and strains. Recent research has shown that naproxen may have antiviral activity against influenza, also known as the flu.

       "  'Phorbol is a natural, plant-derived diterpene. It was first isolated in 1934 as the hydrolysis product of croton oil, which is derived from the seeds of the purging croton, Croton tiglium. The seeds and oil of this special plant have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine, generally as a laxative (purgative). In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response. Phorbol esters are also used to stimulate the immune response in test subjects, and measure their response to pain. On the flip side, some phorbol derivatives have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria.

This medicine belongs to the family of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and it works by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates such as starch and table sugar in the body. Naturally, it can be most commonly found in mulberry leaves, and it can be obtained in small quantities by brewing an herbal tea from mulberry leaves.

       "  'Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe.

This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks.

While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure. This makes abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and acetaminophen potentially fatal.

       "  'Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

Industrially, it is chemically synthesised by reacting fructose with hydrogen. Interestingly, mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants.

Severe deficiency can lead to disorders like beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and optic neuropathy. Hence, thiamine can be taken as a supplement to treat these disorders. Research shows that high thiamine intake as part of the diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts and kidney disease. Interestingly, taking thiamine for 90 days has shown to stop pain associated with menstruation in girls 12-21 years old.

       " ['Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a male sex hormone that helps give males their male characteristics. In humans, this androgen is produced from testosterone through the action of the enzyme 5α-Reductase. and it is extremely important in the development of male genitalia during embryo growth. DHT is also crucial in the maturation of the male sex organs during puberty. Hence, a deficiency of DHT will lead to underdeveloped genitalia and reduced libido. For these men, DHT is available as a supplement for treatment. Unfortunately, the production of too much DHT is thought to cause hair follicles to shrink, weaken and die, causing the characteristic male pattern hair loss. Too much DHT also causes prostrate diseases like prostrate cancer. Thus, DHT-blocking medications are available to promote hair growth and prevent prostrate-related illnesses. A balanced DHT level is thus important for normal body function.

Although ephedrine is not a recommended treatment, it is also used for temporary relief of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing due to bronchial asthma. Ephedrine even promotes modest short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss, and this has led to the creation and marketing of ephedrine-containing supplements. One of them, known as the ECA stack, contains ephenedrine with caffeine and aspirin. It is a popular supplement taken by bodybuilders seeking to cut body fat before a competition. Ephedrine has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analogue.

When uric acid levels in the blood get too high, uric acid starts forming hard crystals in joints, causing pain. Colchicine works by reducing swelling and lessening the buildup of uric acid in joints. Interestingly, colchicine is also a toxin at high doses due to its ability to prevent cells from dividing. Hence, side effects from high doses of colchicine may lead to bone marrow damage and hair loss.

       " ['Nicotinamide (NAA), also known as niacinamide, is a form of vitamin B3 obtained from food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. Usually, nicotinamide can be obtained by eating niacin-rich foods such as poultry, beef, fish and fortified cereal. The body then breaks down niacin forming nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is essential in the body for energy production, DNA repair and cell growth. Interestingly, nicotinamide may help prevent insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, also known as type 1 diabetes. Studies have also shown that it may also play a role in preventing cancer. However, more research will be needed to analyse further whether taking nicotinamide has such beneficial heath effects.

       "  'Ranitidine, marketed under the brand name Zantac, is a medicine that decreases stomach acid production. It is most often used to treat ulcers of the stomach and intestines and prevent them from coming back after they have healed. Ranitidine also treats heartburn, esophagus inflammation, and people who have Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, a condition where the stomach produces too much acid. Interestingly, Ranitidine was introduced by GlaxoSmithKline in 1981, and quickly became the world’s biggest-selling prescription drug since 1987. It has since been superseded by more effective drugs like omeprazole.

It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and to prevent stroke in people who have various heart conditions or artificial heart valves. A very common side effect is bleeding and some tissue damage. Because of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, an overdosage can very easily cause severe bleeding and death without fast treatment. Interestingly, warfarin first came into commercial use in 1948 as a rat poison, though its use as a rat poison is now declining, because many rat populations have developed resistance to it.

       "  'Sarin is a highly toxic synthetic phosphorus compound. A colorless, odorless liquid, it is used as a chemical weapon due to its extreme potency as a nerve agent. Exposure is lethal even at very low concentrations, and death occurs within 1-10 minutes. Sarin will attack the nervous system and cause incredibly painful and uncontrollable muscle contractions. This makes it impossible to breathe, leading to death by asphyxiation. Even people who absorb a non-lethal dose may suffer permanent neurological damage if left untreated. Sarin is notorious for its use as a chemical weapon, especially due to its extremely high toxicity. Most notably, the ruthless Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was accused of genocide after a sarin attack on the rebel town of Khan Sheikhoun in 2011.

Creatine has become an extremely popular body-building sports supplement, as scientific evidence shows that short-term creatine use can increase muscle performance in high-intensity exercise. This is due to creatine’s ability to promote protein synthesis, improve muscle fibre growth, and increase the body’s capacity to produce energy in the form of ATP. Interestingly creatine is also used as treatment for brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, as well as traumatic brain injury.

Uric acid is formed from the breakdown of certain chemicals called purines in the body, and hyperuricemia occurs when the body produces more uric acid than it can eliminate. Gout occurs when the uric acid forms crystals in joints and tissues, causing swelling, inflammation and pain. This disease is a form of arthritis and most classically affects the joint in the base of the big toe. Febuxostat prevents the production of uric acid by blocking the activity of the enzyme (xanthine oxidase) that converts purines to uric acid. Febuxostat is typically only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol, which is the standard medicine used by patients to lower uric acid levels and treat gout. This is due to an increased risk of heart-related deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol.

In fact, it is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it has the name ba dou, and it has been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. Phorbol is also identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple. Interestingly, chemical derivatives of phorbol, such as phorbol esters, are well known to promote the growth of cancer. Hence, it is commonly used in biomedical research to study the mechanism of tumour proliferation and pain response. Phorbol esters are also used to stimulate the immune response in test subjects, and measure their response to pain. On the flip side, some phorbol derivatives have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria.

       "  \"Tabun, also known as GA, is an extremely toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odour. This chemical weapon is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the human nervous system. Symptoms of exposure to Tabun include nervousness, runny nose, excessive salivation, breathing difficulties, sweating, slow heartrate, paralysis and loss of consciousness. Minute exposure to skin can lead to severe blistering and swelling. At high concentrations, Tabun can kill a person within 10 minutes, and a person's clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine.

       "  'Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken orally in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. Typically, it is combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this combination is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain. Unfortunately, long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and tinnitus, along with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

First synthesised in the United States, desomorphine was sold in Switzerland and Russia under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe. This drug can be easily made at home from over-the-counter codeine using lighter fluid, gasoline, hydrochloric acid and red phosphorus. This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks. These side effects has earned krokodil its other nickname: the zombie drug. The typical life span of an addict is just two or three years.

It has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as an analgesic) to the treatment of addiction. While DXM has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses, it can act as a psychedelic drug if extremely large amounts of DXM is consumed. Hence, DXM is often abused as a recreational drug and entheogen for its hallucinogenic effects. DXM is known as a dissociative, meaning when taken, it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. More than half of users reported experience of withdrawal symptoms after long-term or addictive DXM use, such as fatigue, apathy, flashbacks, and constipation. In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use. However, to achieve DXM's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of acetaminophen is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure. This makes abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and acetaminophen potentially fatal.

Industrially, it is chemically synthesised by reacting fructose with hydrogen. Interestingly, mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses.

Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids like morphine or codeine. Because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. However, tramadol is easily obtained via over-the-counter products, making it a commonly abused drug around the world. Tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram. Fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous.

In fact, it is eight to ten times more potent than morphine. Desomorphine has attracted much attention in recent years due to its abuse as a recreational drug, especially in Europe.

This mixture of poisons, also known as krokodil, is a murky yellow liquid with an acrid stink that mimics the euphoria that heroin brings, at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, because of the numerous contaminants in krokodil, wherever on the body a user injects this substance, blood vessels burst and surrounding tissue dies, leading to severe vein injury, gangrene and reports of flesh falling off the bone in chunks.

Glutathione plays a crucial role in many chemical reactions in the body. It also helps detoxify chemicals, including some that the body creates naturally, as well as pollutants and drugs. A deficiency  in glutathione could lead to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, the resulting damage of which is thought to be involved in a plethora of diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease.

As a recreational drug, it is typically smoked, but may be taken by mouth, snorted, or injected. Within less than an hour, PCP can cause intense euphoria, hallucinations, distorted perceptions of sounds, paranoia and violent behaviour. If taken at high doses, PCP is extremely hazardous to human health, as it can cause kidney failure, seizures, coma and even death. PCP is also highly addictive, and PCP abusers generally face severe withdrawal symptoms. Interestingly, PCP was used as an anaesthetic in the 1920s, but it was quickly discontinued due to its psychotic effects and the discovery of safer alternatives.

In humans, this androgen is produced from testosterone through the action of the enzyme 5α-Reductase. and it is extremely important in the development of male genitalia during embryo growth. DHT is also crucial in the maturation of the male sex organs during puberty. Hence, a deficiency of DHT will lead to underdeveloped genitalia and reduced libido. For these men, DHT is available as a supplement for treatment. Unfortunately, the production of too much DHT is thought to cause hair follicles to shrink, weaken and die, causing the characteristic male pattern hair loss.

It belongs to a group of drugs known as statins, and it works by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. It inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in liver tissue that plays a key role in production of cholesterol in the body. Using this medication greatly decreases the risk of heart disease, and helps prevent strokes and heart attacks. Currently, Lipitor has become the best-selling drug in the history of pharmaceuticals, and is expected to stay in the top 20, by revenue.

       " ['Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a male sex hormone that helps give males their male characteristics. In humans, this androgen is produced from testosterone through the action of the enzyme 5α-Reductase. and it is extremely important in the development of male genitalia during embryo growth. DHT is also crucial in the maturation of the male sex organs during puberty. Hence, a deficiency of DHT will lead to underdeveloped genitalia and reduced libido. For these men, DHT is available as a supplement for treatment. Unfortunately, the production of too much DHT is thought to cause hair follicles to shrink, weaken and die, causing the characteristic male pattern hair loss. Too much DHT also causes prostrate diseases like prostrate cancer. Thus, DHT-blocking medications are available to promote hair growth and prevent prostrate-related illnesses. A balanced DHT level is thus important for normal body function.

Although ephedrine is not a recommended treatment, it is also used for temporary relief of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing due to bronchial asthma. Ephedrine even promotes modest short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss, and this has led to the creation and marketing of ephedrine-containing supplements. One of them, known as the ECA stack, contains ephenedrine with caffeine and aspirin. It is a popular supplement taken by bodybuilders seeking to cut body fat before a competition. Ephedrine has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analogue. This has made ephedrine a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.

       " ['Nicotinamide (NAA), also known as niacinamide, is a form of vitamin B3 obtained from food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. Usually, nicotinamide can be obtained by eating niacin-rich foods such as poultry, beef, fish and fortified cereal. The body then breaks down niacin forming nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is essential in the body for energy production, DNA repair and cell growth. Interestingly, nicotinamide may help prevent insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, also known as type 1 diabetes. Studies have also shown that it may also play a role in preventing cancer. However, more research will be needed to analyse further whether taking nicotinamide has such beneficial heath effects.

       "  'Ranitidine, marketed under the brand name Zantac, is a medicine that decreases stomach acid production. It is most often used to treat ulcers of the stomach and intestines and prevent them from coming back after they have healed. Ranitidine also treats heartburn, esophagus inflammation, and people who have Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, a condition where the stomach produces too much acid. Interestingly, Ranitidine was introduced by GlaxoSmithKline in 1981, and quickly became the world’s biggest-selling prescription drug since 1987. It has since been superseded by more effective drugs like omeprazole.

It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and to prevent stroke in people who have various heart conditions or artificial heart valves. A very common side effect is bleeding and some tissue damage. Because of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, an overdosage can very easily cause severe bleeding and death without fast treatment. Interestingly, warfarin first came into commercial use in 1948 as a rat poison, though its use as a rat poison is now declining, because many rat populations have developed resistance to it.

       "  'Sarin is a highly toxic synthetic phosphorus compound. A colorless, odorless liquid, it is used as a chemical weapon due to its extreme potency as a nerve agent. Exposure is lethal even at very low concentrations, and death occurs within 1-10 minutes. Sarin will attack the nervous system and cause incredibly painful and uncontrollable muscle contractions. This makes it impossible to breathe, leading to death by asphyxiation. Even people who absorb a non-lethal dose may suffer permanent neurological damage if left untreated. Sarin is notorious for its use as a chemical weapon, especially due to its extremely high toxicity. Most notably, the ruthless Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was accused of genocide after a sarin attack on the rebel town of Khan Sheikhoun in 2011.

       "  'Creatine is an amino acid that is naturally found in muscle and brain cells of humans and other vertebrates. Most people obtain creatine from creatine-rich food like seafood and red meat. Creatine has become an extremely popular body-building sports supplement, as scientific evidence shows that short-term creatine use can increase muscle performance in high-intensity exercise. This is due to creatine’s ability to promote protein synthesis, improve muscle fibre growth, and increase the body’s capacity to produce energy in the form of ATP. Interestingly creatine is also used as treatment for brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, as well as traumatic brain injury.

It has amphiphilic properties, meanjng it has a hydrophilic and hydrophobic end, and hence it can act as a detergent and surfactant. Industrially SDS is produced by treating lauryl alcohol, which can be derived from coconut oil, with sulfur trioxide. SDS is mainly used in laundry detergents due to its high cleaning power, as well as shampoos and shaving creams due to its ability to create a foam. In biology, SDS is very commonly used to cause cells to swell and burst to extract DNA from cells for further studies.

THC is one of the many compounds secreted by the marijuana plant, and is the compound responsible for the psychological effects of marijuana. THC stimulates brain cells to release dopamine, creating euphoria, and interferes with how information is processed in the hippocampus. Hence the effects of marijuana makes it one of the most popular recreational drugs, despite side effects including anxiety, memory loss, hallucinations and impaired motor skills. Interestingly, THC also has many medical benefits, such as treating nausea, vomiting, and even cancer. Dronabinol, a drug containing THC, has in fact been approved by the US FDA.

Up until Operation Web Tryp and three deaths, two of which involved the use of other drugs in addition to 2C-T-7, and one which involved an excessive insufflated dose, 2C-T-7 was sold commercially in Dutch and Japanese smartshops and online.

Palytoxin is a #natural #compound, #chemically a fatty alcohol, that is produced by several #anthozoans but can be found in many more species, especially #fish, due to the process of #biomagnification. Palytoxin was originally isolated in 1971 in Hawaii from the seaweed-like #coral limu-make-o-Hana ('seaweed of death from Hana').[4] In 1982, its full chemical structure was published by Prof. Daisuke Uemura and co-workers at Nagoya University. Yoshito Kishi's group at Harvard University first synthesized palytoxin in 1994. Palytoxin targets the sodium-potassium pump protein by locking it into a position where it allows passive transport of both sodium and potassium ions, thereby destroying the ion gradient that is essential for life. Because palytoxin can affect every type of cell in the body, the symptoms can be very different for the various routes of exposure. The most common exposure in humans is by ingestion or inhalation. The onset of symptoms is rapid, and death usually follows quickly. (Wikipedia)\\n\\nFurther reading: Budavari, Susan, ed.

       "  \"#Palytoxin is an intense #vasoconstrictor, and is considered to be one of the most #toxic non-protein substances known, second only to #maitotoxin in terms of #toxicity in mice. Palytoxin is a #natural #compound, #chemically a fatty alcohol, that is produced by several #anthozoans but can be found in many more species, especially #fish, due to the process of #biomagnification. Palytoxin was originally isolated in 1971 in Hawaii from the seaweed-like #coral limu-make-o-Hana ('seaweed of death from Hana').[4] In 1982, its full chemical structure was published by Prof. Daisuke Uemura and co-workers at Nagoya University. Yoshito Kishi's group at Harvard University first synthesized palytoxin in 1994. Palytoxin targets the sodium-potassium pump protein by locking it into a position where it allows passive transport of both sodium and potassium ions, thereby destroying the ion gradient that is essential for life. Because palytoxin can affect every type of cell in the body, the symptoms can be very different for the various routes of exposure. The most common exposure in humans is by ingestion or inhalation. The onset of symptoms is rapid, and death usually follows quickly. (Wikipedia)\\n\\nFurther reading: Budavari, Susan, ed.

Treating this #compound with #diethylamine in diethyl #ether causes #elimination of two equivalents of hydrogen bromide to give the #diene #product. (Image 1)\\n\\nThe construction of the eight-carbon cubane framework begins when 2-bromocyclopentadienone undergoes a spontaneous Diels-Alder dimerization, analogous to the dimerization of cyclopentadiene to dicyclopentadiene—two molecules of 1 react to form 2. For the subsequent steps to succeed, only the endo isomer is useful, and this is the predominant isomer formed in this reaction. This is the most likely product as a result of minimized steric interactions between the bromine of each molecule with the bromine and carbonyl of the other when the reactants approach each other and minimized like-dipole interactions in the transition state of the reaction itself. Both carbonyl groups are protected as acetals with ethylene glycol and p-toluenesulfonic acid in benzene; one acetal is then selectively deprotected with aqueous hydrochloric acid to 3.\\nIn the next step, the endo isomer 3 (with both alkene groups in close proximity) forms the cage-like isomer 4 in a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The bromoketone group is converted to ring-contracted carboxylic acid 5 in a Favorskii rearrangement with potassium hydroxide. Next, the thermal decarboxylation takes place through the acid chloride (with thionyl chloride) and the tert-butyl perester 6 (with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and pyridine) to 7; afterward, the acetal is once more removed in 8. A second #Favorskii #rearrangement gives 9, and finally another #decarboxylation gives, via 10, cubane (11). (Image 2)\\n\\nReferences:\\nEaton, Philip E.; Cole, Thomas W. (1964). \"Cubane\". J. Am.
